#Geoff Schrecker's Website

This is where I will start building my own website. It's a bit of a  project as I have just retired after spending my working life in UK General Practice and Clinical Informatics.

It will probably be a slow burner as I also intend to spend more time volunteering for the [National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk){target=_blank} in the beautiful Peak District. So it might just be a place I stick the odd nice picture and some walks!

So far I have got it started, using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com){target=_blank} and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

Oh the weather outside is:
